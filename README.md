## :dart: About

An interactive, 3D augmented reality (AR) application featuring a floating, distorting portal that is a window to another world. Using your phone, you can enter AR mode and experience the 3D AR portal which shows you glimpses of another world superimposed on your live surroundings which are fed in by the phone's camera feed. It allows you to switch worlds when you tap on the portal via the phone. You will be able to experience the new world in 3D and real-time by panning your phone about and observing it in 360 degrees. While you are in the new world, the floating portal shows you your real surroundings via the camera.
